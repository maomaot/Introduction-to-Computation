What does a compututer do ?
Fundamentally a computer:
-Performs calculations (计算）
-Remember's the results （记录结果）
What calculations?
-Built in primitives  （构建原语）
-Creating our own methods of calculating (学会如何创造自己的计算方法)
Are simple calculations enought?
Searching the World Wide Web
Playing chess
Good algorithm design
also needed to
accomplish a task!
so are there limits?
·Despite it's speed and storage, a computer does have limitations
-Some problems still too complex
 ·Accurate weather prediction at a local scale
 ·Craking encryption schemes
 -Some problems are fundamentally impossible to compute
 ·Predicting whether a piece of code will always halt with an answer for any input
Computational problem solving
What is computation?
-What is knowledge?
-Declarative knowledge (陈述性知识)
·Statements of fact （事实陈述）
-Imperative knowledge （程序性知识=操作方法）
·"how to" methods or recipes （操作方法）
Declarative knowledge
·“The square root of a number X is a number Y such that Y*Y=X”  (square root平方根)
·Can you use this to find the square toot of a particular instance of X? (能用这个陈述去解平方根吗) A:NO
Imperative knowledge 
推导平方根的方法（描述）=》 如果要找出答案，首先要给出一个猜测
Here is a "recipe" for deducing a square root of a number X ——attributed to Heron of Alexandria in the first in the first century AD（这个算法发明人有争议）
